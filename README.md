## Welcome to my GitHub WebPage

I'm [Aymane ISSAMI](https://issamiaymane.com), currently an Engineering student at ENSAM. An ambitious student, first year on the higher school preparatory classes at the National School of Arts and Crafts in Morocco. I hope to one day fix the biggest problems in the world, and will use my time in college to explore every facet of engineering to find what interests me the most.
